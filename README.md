## 🛠 Git and Github Setup
Below are instructions for how to set up Git and Github on your computer.

* Create an account on Github - https://github.com/join
* Download and install Git - https://git-scm.com/downloads
  * For Macs: if you do not already have homebrew installed and are not familiar with using the command line, you can use the Binary installer.
* Download a Text Editor. A text editor is a program that you use to modify and write code. If you do not already have a text edtior, here are some suggestions: 
  *  [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
  *  [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  *  [Atom](https://atom.io/)

## 👩🏾‍💻 Command Line
![Screenshots of the command line](imgs/command-line-header.png)
The command line is a text interface that you can use to run commands on your computer. Mac (Terminal) and Windows (Command Prompt) computers both come with default command lines. You can find and open these command lines by searching for the name (Terminal or Command Prompt) on your computer. 

### Alternative Command Lines
* [iTerm2 (Mac)](https://iterm2.com/): Powerful terminal replacement for macOS
* [Hyper.js](https://hyper.is/): A beautiful, feature filled terminal created with Electron.js
* [Terminus (Windows, macOS and Linux)](https://eugeny.github.io/terminus/): A highly configurable terminal emulator
* [eDEX-UI](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui) - A TRON/Sci-fi inspired terminal
* Git Bash (Windows - is including when you download [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads)) 

### Command Line Resources
* [Terminal (Mac) Command Line Cheatsheet](https://github.com/0nn0/terminal-mac-cheatsheet): A cheatsheet for the Terminal (Mac) command line.
* [Command Prompt (Windows) Command Line Cheatsheet](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~sedwards/classes/2015/1102-fall/Command%20Prompt%20Cheatsheet.pdf): A cheatsheet for Command Prompt (Windows).

Initializes Git
Tells Git to start tracking your files
Run inside of a directory (folder)

### Git Status
![Github Octocats](imgs/git-status.png)
Outputs the status of your files
What branch you are on
Which files are being tracked
Which files have been altered
Local branch vs remote branch

### Git Add
![Github Octocats](imgs/git-add.png)
Tells Git which files to add to the staging area
Can add all files
Can add individual files

### Git Commit
![Github Octocats](imgs/git-commit.png)
```git commit``` saves a snapshot of your entire project. You run the command with the `-m` flag to include a message. This message will typically explain what was changed in the code. Here is an example of what running ```git commit``` could look like: ```git commit -m “your commit message here”```. You should commit often!
