## üëãüèæ Introduction
This is supporting documentation for an Intro to Git & GitHub Workshop. You will learn about Git and GitHub, some of the most popular version control tools. We will cover the command line, commonly used Git commands, what open source is and how you can utilize Git and GitHub to manage your own projects and to collaborate with others. 

## ü§î What is Git?
<img src="imgs/hearding-cats.gif" alt="Gif of someone attempting to heard a bunch of kittens and failing" width="500">

Git is a version control system used to track and manage changes made to files. This tool allows teams to work more efficently together and avoid mistakes that might arise from conflicting code, bugs and so on. Benefits of using version control include:

* Ability to track **what** code has been changed
* Ability to see **who** has changed it
* Ability to see **when** it was changed 
* And the option to revert to previous versions if needed

## üßê What is GitHub?
![GitHub Octocats](imgs/github-header.png)

GitHub is a website where you can host code, collaborate with others and utilize Git version control tools. **Note:** Very important to remember that ```Git``` and ```GitHub``` are two different things. Some features of GitHub include: 
* Collaboration (open-source): View other people's code and collaborate on projects.
* Storage: Upload your code to store it remotely vs just on your local machine.
* Hosting: Deploy websites with the option of custom domains
* Management: Automation, manage to do lists (Projects), create Wikis, team organization  
* And much more

Alternatives: [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) & [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product)

## üõ† Git and GitHub Setup
Below are instructions for how to set up Git and GitHub on your computer.

* Create an account on GitHub - https://github.com/join
* Download and install Git - https://git-scm.com/downloads
  * For Macs: if you do not already have homebrew installed and are not familiar with using the command line, you can use the Binary installer.
* Download a Text Editor. A text editor is a program that you use to modify and write code. If you do not already have a text edtior, here are some suggestions: 
  *  [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
  *  [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  *  [Atom](https://atom.io/)

## üë©üèæ‚Äçüíª Command Line
![Screenshots of the command line](imgs/command-line-header.png)
The command line is a text interface that you can use to run commands on your computer. Mac (Terminal) and Windows (Command Prompt) computers both come with default command lines. You can find and open these command lines by searching for the name (Terminal or Command Prompt) on your computer. 

### Alternative Command Lines
* [iTerm2 (Mac)](https://iterm2.com/): Powerful terminal replacement for macOS
* [Hyper.js](https://hyper.is/): A beautiful, feature filled terminal created with Electron.js
* [Terminus (Windows, macOS and Linux)](https://eugeny.github.io/terminus/): A highly configurable terminal emulator
* [eDEX-UI](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui) - A TRON/Sci-fi inspired terminal
* Git Bash (Windows - is including when you download [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads)) 

### Command Line Resources
* [Terminal (Mac) Command Line Cheatsheet](https://github.com/0nn0/terminal-mac-cheatsheet): A cheatsheet for the Terminal (Mac) command line.
* [Command Prompt (Windows) Command Line Cheatsheet](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~sedwards/classes/2015/1102-fall/Command%20Prompt%20Cheatsheet.pdf): A cheatsheet for Command Prompt (Windows).
* [Command Line Power User](https://wesbos.com/command-line-video-tutorials/): A free video course that walks you through customizing your terminal and increasing functionality.

## ü¶Ñ Git Commands
![Screenshots of the command line](imgs/git-command-header.png)
We're going to briefly go over just a few of the most commonly used Git commands below. These will get you started using Git but there are many more commands you can utilize. Check out the resources after this section for more information.

*** 

![Screenshot of terminal running git init command](imgs/git-init.png)
### Git Init
```git init``` initializes Git. After this command is run, Git will start tracking your files.  

* Run inside of a directory (folder). Any changes you make in that folder will then be tracked by Git.

***

![Screenshot of terminal running git status command](imgs/git-status.png)
### Git Status
```git status``` outputs the status of your files. This is a command that is used very often.

Some information git status can give you includes: 
* What branch you are on
* Which files are being tracked
* Which files have been altered
* What the status is of your local branch vs the remote branch

***

![Screenshot of terminal running git add command](imgs/git-add.png)
### Git Add
```git add``` tells Git which files to add to the staging area before comitting.
* Can add all files: ```git add .```
* Can add individual files: ```git add index.html main.css```

***

![Screenshot of terminal running git commit command](imgs/git-commit.png)
### Git Commit
```git commit``` saves a snapshot of your entire project. You run the command with the `-m` flag to include a message. This message will typically explain what was changed in the code. Here is an example of what running ```git commit``` could look like: ```git commit -m ‚Äúyour commit message here‚Äù```. You should commit often!

  * [Official Git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit)

***

![Screenshot of terminal running git push command](imgs/git-push.png)
### Git Push
```git push``` sends code from your local branch to your remote branch. In this case, it is sending to GitHub.
