## 🛠 Git and Github Setup
Below are instructions for how to set up Git and Github on your computer.

- Create an account on Github - https://github.com/join
- Download and install Git - https://git-scm.com/downloads
- Download a Text Editor
A text editor is a program that you use to modify and write code. If you do not already have a text edtior, here are some suggestions: 
- Sublime Text
- Visual Studio Code
- Atom

## 👩🏾‍💻 Command Line
The command line is a text interface that you can use to run commands on your computer. Mac (Terminal) and Windows (Command Prompt) computers both come with default command lines. You can find and open these command lines by searching for the name (Terminal or Command Prompt) on your computer. 

### Alternative Command Lines
- Git Bash (Windows) 
- iTerm2 (Mac): Powerful terminal replacement for macOS
- Hyper.js: A beautiful, feature filled terminal created with Electron.js
- Terminus (Windows, macOS and Linux): A highly configurable terminal emulator
- eDEX-UI - A TRON/Sci-fi inspired terminal
